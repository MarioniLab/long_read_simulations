# Long-read sequencing simulation evaluations 

This repository contains scripts used for long-read sequencing simulation evaluations in Berrens et al. 2020.

The structure of the repository is:

- `repeat_simulation`: contains scripts for long-read sequencing simulation evaluation of repeat elements alignment and extended result for L1 elements simulation evaluation from the CELLO-seq manuscript. 
- `umi_simulation`: contains scripts for simulated UMI grouping evaluation and extended result for UMI grouping simulation evaluation from the CELLO-seq manuscript.
- `pipeline`: contains modified scripts for the CELLO-seq Sarlacc data processing pipeline specific to long-read sequencing simulation evaluations 
- `Badread`: contains a modified version of [Badread](https://github.com/rrwick/Badread) simulator for long-read sequencing simulation evaluations
